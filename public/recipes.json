Plus, participants get rewarded for helping in the process. In exchange for delegating your crypto, you get rewarded with more assets from the network. To generate staking rewards on a Proof of Stake blockchain, a node has to designate a certain amount of tokens on the network as a stake (similar to a security deposit). The chance of that node being chosen to validate the next block is typically proportional to the number of tokens being staked. If the node successfully validates a block, it is awarded the staking reward, similar to a miner being rewarded in Proof of Work chains. Validators lose part of their stake if they approve a fraudulent transaction — this incentivizes them to only approve valid transactions.",
